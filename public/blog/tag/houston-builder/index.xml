      <description>In our final Foundation Fundamentals series, we’re talking about a foundation that is most commonly known to homeowners as a Pier and Beam foundation. We call it a Crawl-Space Foundation and use it most often when clients are in a floodplain and require an elevated home.

      <description>We’re continuing the great debate of foundations with everything you need to know about a Post Tension Slab. Take a look at Part 1 of our Basics of Building series to learn more about building science and what we do differently from other builders.
**Post Tension Slab
