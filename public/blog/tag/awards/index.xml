      <description>The office is looking a bit shinier this week! As many of you know, On Point is a proud member of the Greater Houston Builder’s Association and has been since we started building. One of our favorite annual company traditions is the GHBA PRISM Awards + Gala! Over the last ten+ years, we’ve won multiple design and marketing awards and the streak continues.
We were honored to bring home six “Houston’s Best” awards and were finalists in six additional categories.</description>
