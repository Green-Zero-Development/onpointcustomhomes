      <description>On Point is known for our custom design + build program; however, we also love helping clients transform their existing home with major remodel projects! In this three-part series, weâ€™re showing you the before and afters of this Briargrove home that needed a major facelift.
On Point took on the challenge of updating this house without altering the overall footprint. We did update every surface, fixture and finish for the entire interior and exterior and came back and added a freestanding outdoor entertaining space complete with a wood-burning fireplace, surround sound, TV and ample seating.</description>
