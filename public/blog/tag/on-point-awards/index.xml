      <description>If you follow the adventures of On Point on Facebook and Instagram, you’ve probably heard the news already, but if not, we’re excited to share that our team brought home some new hardware from the Texas Association of Builders!

Garrett, Tiffany and Ashley spent the last half of last week in Dallas attending the Sunbelt Builders Show put on by the Texas Association of Builders.</description>
