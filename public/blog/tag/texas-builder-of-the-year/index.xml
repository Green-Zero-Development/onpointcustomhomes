      <description>Located in the heart of Meyerland, this brand new custom home was designed and built five feet off the ground after our clients endured not one, but two floods in their prior one-story ranch.
After purchasing and remodeling the home, the home was stuck in the 2015 Memorial Day flood. They reached out to On Point shortly after looking for guidance on whether a second remodel or a complete rebuild made the most sense.</description>
