      <description>Last week our Selections Coordinator extraordinaire, Tiffany, spent the week in Chicago learning all about two of our favorite appliance brands, Thermador and Bosch, newest luxury product lines. In fact, we love them both so much almost every home we build has one, if not both, in the appliance packages. Not only did Tiffany get a first look at the new products coming out this fall and beyond, but she also got some serious lessons in both steam oven and induction cooking, two trends that are taking off in kitchen design.</description>
