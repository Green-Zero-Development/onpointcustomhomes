The Coronavirus pandemic has forced the world to make changes and adapt in virtually all aspects of life. With the school year quickly approaching, it is becoming more and more apparent that school may look very different for young students this year. With that in mind, it is very important that your children have a space that makes adapting to zoom schooling a little easier and helps separate their work and school space from the rest of your home.</description>

      <description>Located in the heart of Meyerland, this brand new custom home was designed and built five feet off the ground after our clients endured not one, but two floods in their prior one-story ranch.
After purchasing and remodeling the home, the home was stuck in the 2015 Memorial Day flood. They reached out to On Point shortly after looking for guidance on whether a second remodel or a complete rebuild made the most sense.</description>
