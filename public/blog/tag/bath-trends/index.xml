      <description>At On Point Custom Homes, we truly believe in exploring new ideas and staying ahead of the curve when it comes to architectural design, product integration, and building science. We make it a point to attend a variety of industry shows across the county throughout the year in order to keep our team apart of conversations in the building space and in front of the latest and greatest products. Most recently our CEO, President, Selections Coordinator, Purchasing Manager and Marketing Director took a trip to Orlando to attend the National Association of Home Builders International Builder Show as well as the Kitchen and Bath Show.</description>
