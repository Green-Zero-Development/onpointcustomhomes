      <guid>https://onpointcustomhomes.netlify.com/blog/what-is-a-radiant-barrier-on-residential-roof-decking/</guid>
      <description>We all know about the Houston, TX heat!! The primary reason to install a radiant barrier is reduce heat gain in the Summer and heat loss in the Winter. This is accomplished by reflecting the suns rays back toward the actual roof and not allowing them fully to penetrate the attic space.
There are many different applications for radiant barriers in residential attics. On new construction custom homes, the most common is for On Point Custom Homes is to install roof decking with the radiant barrier attached to the bottom of the decking.</description>

      <description>On Point Custom Homes uses quartz in many of our modern Houston homes. Clients often ask why we use quartz…there are many reasons, but let’s cover some of the top reasons.
1) We believe quartz gives a more modern touch to a contemporary style home than granite. It has a clean overall feel and modern enthusiasts seem to be gravitating toward quartz countertops.
2) Ease of mainteance. Quite simply On Point Custom Homes recommends a damp cloth with warm water and soap to wipe down quartz.</description>

      <guid>https://onpointcustomhomes.netlify.com/blog/what-defines-a-houston-modern-home/</guid>
      <description>Houston itself is really a very old city, first founded in 1836 and then incorporated the very next year. It has modest beginnings until 1901 when it became a major oil producing area as well as a railway hub. The increasing workforce that these two types of industry brought into the then small town led to very rapid growth and the demand for both economic and luxury types of homes. Houston modern homes are not considered to be these original structures, although many of the plantation style mansions still gloriously line the streets of the older parts of the city.</description>

      <description>Houston modern patio homes offer the “lock and leave” lifestyle.
Lock and leave is a term often used by Realtors and marketers when describing the positive attributes or features of Houston modern patio homes. This term means that the owners can simply lock up and leave the home, which is important for those that travel for business or enjoy an easy maintenance lifestyle. The lower cost of owning a Houston modern patio home makes these home types a great option for people that only want to live in Texas for part of the year, who have kids leaving for college and want to downsize or want to live in a trendy location.</description>
