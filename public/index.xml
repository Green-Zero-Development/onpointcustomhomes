      <description>Dana is no stranger to the homebuilding industry, in fact she often jokes that the homebuilding industry chose her. Coming from a family of humbly skilled craftsman, who together built their family’s lake house, barn, and various custom furniture pieces, is one of the reasons she made her way into the industry.
After joining a Houston-area custom builder shortly after graduating from the University of North Texas, she had the opportunity to work in various departments of the business from bidding and purchasing to permitting and accounting and eventually worked her way up to the selections team where she collaborated with architects and homeowners on interior finishes.</description>

      <description>I was born and raised in Columbus, Texas; a small rural town about 60 miles West of Houston. Construction is in my blood as I grew up assisting my dad on many job sites helping him with building homes, remodeling, and doing all types of construction. When not tagging along on construction site visits, I played football, was on the powerlifting team and was active in Boy Scouts. After graduating high school, I attended Blinn College in Brenham and transferred to Sam Houston State University where I received a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance and a minor in Banking.</description>

      <description>Growing up in North Carolina, John’s introduction to the residential construction industry began as a young boy when his father, an airline pilot, decided to pursue a personal interest and start a construction company. John would often tag along with his father visiting job sites, and quickly became a regular fixture where he started learning the ins and outs of residential construction.
John attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he received his Masters in Accounting and BS in Business Administration from the Kenan-Flagler Business School.</description>
