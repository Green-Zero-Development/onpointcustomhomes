      <description>Dana is no stranger to the homebuilding industry, in fact she often jokes that the homebuilding industry chose her. Coming from a family of humbly skilled craftsman, who together built their family’s lake house, barn, and various custom furniture pieces, is one of the reasons she made her way into the industry.
After joining a Houston-area custom builder shortly after graduating from the University of North Texas, she had the opportunity to work in various departments of the business from bidding and purchasing to permitting and accounting and eventually worked her way up to the selections team where she collaborated with architects and homeowners on interior finishes.</description>

      <description>I was born and raised in Columbus, Texas; a small rural town about 60 miles West of Houston. Construction is in my blood as I grew up assisting my dad on many job sites helping him with building homes, remodeling, and doing all types of construction. When not tagging along on construction site visits, I played football, was on the powerlifting team and was active in Boy Scouts. After graduating high school, I attended Blinn College in Brenham and transferred to Sam Houston State University where I received a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance and a minor in Banking.</description>

      <description>Growing up in North Carolina, John’s introduction to the residential construction industry began as a young boy when his father, an airline pilot, decided to pursue a personal interest and start a construction company. John would often tag along with his father visiting job sites, and quickly became a regular fixture where he started learning the ins and outs of residential construction.
John attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he received his Masters in Accounting and BS in Business Administration from the Kenan-Flagler Business School.</description>

      <title>What is a radiant barrier on residential roof decking?</title>
      <link>https://onpointcustomhomes.netlify.com/blog/what-is-a-radiant-barrier-on-residential-roof-decking/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2013 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://onpointcustomhomes.netlify.com/blog/what-is-a-radiant-barrier-on-residential-roof-decking/</guid>
      <description>We all know about the Houston, TX heat!! The primary reason to install a radiant barrier is reduce heat gain in the Summer and heat loss in the Winter. This is accomplished by reflecting the suns rays back toward the actual roof and not allowing them fully to penetrate the attic space.
There are many different applications for radiant barriers in residential attics. On new construction custom homes, the most common is for On Point Custom Homes is to install roof decking with the radiant barrier attached to the bottom of the decking.</description>

      <description>You may have seen a builder with initials after their name on a business card and often asked what that pertains to. It likely is an accreditation earned through the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). These accreditations demonstrate a builders commitment to continuing education, customer service and an overall understanding of today’s dynamic home building industry.
On Point Custom Homes commitment to these ideals is recognized in our staff’s ability to earn Certified Graduate Builder (CGB) degrees through the NAHB.</description>

      <title>Why is quartz gaining popularity in Houston homes?</title>
      <link>https://onpointcustomhomes.netlify.com/blog/why-is-quartz-gaining-popularity-in-houston-homes/</link>

      <guid>https://onpointcustomhomes.netlify.com/blog/why-is-quartz-gaining-popularity-in-houston-homes/</guid>
      <description>On Point Custom Homes uses quartz in many of our modern Houston homes. Clients often ask why we use quartz…there are many reasons, but let’s cover some of the top reasons.
1) We believe quartz gives a more modern touch to a contemporary style home than granite. It has a clean overall feel and modern enthusiasts seem to be gravitating toward quartz countertops.
2) Ease of mainteance. Quite simply On Point Custom Homes recommends a damp cloth with warm water and soap to wipe down quartz.</description>

      <description>Houston itself is really a very old city, first founded in 1836 and then incorporated the very next year. It has modest beginnings until 1901 when it became a major oil producing area as well as a railway hub. The increasing workforce that these two types of industry brought into the then small town led to very rapid growth and the demand for both economic and luxury types of homes. Houston modern homes are not considered to be these original structures, although many of the plantation style mansions still gloriously line the streets of the older parts of the city.</description>

      <description>Houston modern patio homes offer the “lock and leave” lifestyle.
Lock and leave is a term often used by Realtors and marketers when describing the positive attributes or features of Houston modern patio homes. This term means that the owners can simply lock up and leave the home, which is important for those that travel for business or enjoy an easy maintenance lifestyle. The lower cost of owning a Houston modern patio home makes these home types a great option for people that only want to live in Texas for part of the year, who have kids leaving for college and want to downsize or want to live in a trendy location.</description>
