      <description>I was born and raised in Columbus, Texas; a small rural town about 60 miles West of Houston. Construction is in my blood as I grew up assisting my dad on many job sites helping him with building homes, remodeling, and doing all types of construction. When not tagging along on construction site visits, I played football, was on the powerlifting team and was active in Boy Scouts. After graduating high school, I attended Blinn College in Brenham and transferred to Sam Houston State University where I received a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance and a minor in Banking.</description>

      <description>Dana is no stranger to the homebuilding industry, in fact she often jokes that the homebuilding industry chose her. Coming from a family of humbly skilled craftsman, who together built their family’s lake house, barn, and various custom furniture pieces, is one of the reasons she made her way into the industry.
After joining a Houston-area custom builder shortly after graduating from the University of North Texas, she had the opportunity to work in various departments of the business from bidding and purchasing to permitting and accounting and eventually worked her way up to the selections team where she collaborated with architects and homeowners on interior finishes.</description>

      <description>These days “smart home” is at the top of many homeowner’s wish list and at On Point, part of our mission is to always stay ahead of the building curve and embrace emerging technology, so our homes are never behind the times. While you may think of Nest, Eco Bee, Alexa and Ring when you think of smart homes, On Point’s integration of smart technology goes much further than being install-ready for trending tech products.</description>

      <description>The office is looking a bit shinier this week! As many of you know, On Point is a proud member of the Greater Houston Builder’s Association and has been since we started building. One of our favorite annual company traditions is the GHBA PRISM Awards + Gala! Over the last ten+ years, we’ve won multiple design and marketing awards and the streak continues.

      <guid>https://onpointcustomhomes.netlify.com/blog/designing-your-perfect-built-ins-cabinets/</guid>
      <description>One of the most common remodeling requests is the addition of built-ins. Not only do they add a focal point to the space, but built-ins also give you the opportunity to enhance your storage with the addition of new cabinetry. Adding or updating built-ins and cabinetry can make an enormous impact on your home’s aesthetic. That being said, there are endless styles when it comes to cabinetry design, so we’re breaking down what you need to know to get started.</description>

      <description>We’ve officially gotten through the worst of Houston’s hot and humid summer, but I’m sure many of you are still enjoying the luxury of a great air conditioning system as we creep info fall. You can have a great HVAC system, but it only goes so far without proper insulation. We’re dropping some knowledge on how we handle insulating our homes to ensure it’s as energy efficient as possible to keep your home’s temperature regulated all year long.</description>

      <description>If you follow the adventures of On Point on Facebook and Instagram, you’ve probably heard the news already, but if not, we’re excited to share that our team brought home some new hardware from the Texas Association of Builders! And by hardware, we mean awards, although we probably brought back some actual hardware samples, too.
Garrett, Tiffany and Ashley spent the last half of last week in Dallas attending the Sunbelt Builders Show put on by the Texas Association of Builders.</description>

      <description>As you guys know, On Point makes it a point to support our community and give back both with time and charitable contributions. Throughout our history, we’ve worked with a variety of local and national organizations to give back in different ways. We have a longstanding history with Habitat for Humanity, Houston Food Bank and Candlelighters and last year had the amazing opportunity to work with the Ronald McDonald House of Houston to design + build a custom playhouse for the residents of the home.</description>

      <description>Windows play an important role in your home as their various styles, materials and colors will significantly impact the architectural design and overall aesthetic. More importantly, they also are a significant piece of your home’s energy efficiency puzzle.
With today’s energy codes, all the windows going into our new homes are double paned with a gas insulation. We believe in going above and beyond minimum standards, so all of our windows use a high-grade performance low-e glass.</description>

      <description>Too often people are surprised to hear we offer in-house architectural design services in addition to building and remodeling. Not only do we offer architecture services, but we utilize a 3D design software that most residential teams don’t take advantage of. Designing all of our plans in 3D is a win-win for everyone involved as it brings a set of plans to life before an ounce of dirt is moved.</description>

      <description>Protecting your home from water is paramount to your home’s lifespan. Investing in products that protect against the inevitable water penetration can have lasting impacts on the longevity of your home. In this week’s Basics of Building series, we’re diving into water barrier protection plans with housewrap and rainscreens.
First up – Housewrap. To you it looks like we’ve wrapped your home in some fancy plastic cling wrap, but the reality is that cling wrap is your number one defense against water damage.</description>

      <description>Last week our Selections Coordinator extraordinaire, Tiffany, spent the week in Chicago learning all about two of our favorite appliance brands, Thermador and Bosch, newest luxury product lines. In fact, we love them both so much almost every home we build has one, if not both, in the appliance packages. Not only did Tiffany get a first look at the new products coming out this fall and beyond, but she also got some serious lessons in both steam oven and induction cooking, two trends that are taking off in kitchen design.</description>

      <description>In our final Foundation Fundamentals series, we’re talking about a foundation that is most commonly known to homeowners as a Pier and Beam foundation. We call it a Crawl-Space Foundation and use it most often when clients are in a floodplain and require an elevated home.
**Crawl-Space Foundation
**For those of you who live in a floodplain (hello to our friends in Meyerland + Bellaire!) you need a Crawl-Space Foundation. This is a typical pier and beam foundation, which elevates the home leaving a crawl-space underneath.</description>

      <description>We’re continuing the great debate of foundations with everything you need to know about a Post Tension Slab. Take a look at Part 1 of our Basics of Building series to learn more about building science and what we do differently from other builders.
**Post Tension Slab
**If you are looking for a more cost-effective foundation, consider using a Post Tension Slab. In this technique, you eliminate the need for piers with the addition of beams and tension cables that provide extra stability.</description>

      <description>We recently completed a modern farmhouse in Oak Forest that may be one of our favorite projects this year! The home started as an inventory home but was purchased mid-construction turning the adorable 4 bedroom, 3.5 bath family home into a semi-custom job. With modern farmhouse style continuing to grow in popularity, take a look below for tips from our team on capturing this style.

      <description>In our final reveal of this major remodel project, we’re talking all about the outdoors. With spring weather in full swing, you’ll be daydreaming about this stunning exterior transformation for days.
Without altering the architecture of the existing home, we modernized the facade with a fresh coat of paint. We removed the shutters and opted for a clean transitional aesthetic. The doors remained the same; however, they also received new paint.</description>

      <description>In case you missed the first two posts about this Briargrove whole-home remodel, take a look here! When we took on this project the overall layout of the home did not need many changes; however, the finishes were ready for some updates. In this week’s series, we’re sharing the before and afters of the bedrooms and bathrooms. The home featured a kid’s study nook with built-ins that we ripped out in order to transform the space for added functionality for a nursery.</description>

      <description>Who doesn’t love a kitchen makeover?! This Briargrove home had a good footprint but needed some remodel love to make the room feel more timeless. On Point resurfaced the entire room to transform this family’s kitchen from drab to fab.
All new paint, countertops, hardware, lighting, and sink + faucet goes a long way! Take a look at the final product below.</description>

On Point took on the challenge of updating this house without altering the overall footprint. We did update every surface, fixture and finish for the entire interior and exterior and came back and added a freestanding outdoor entertaining space complete with a wood-burning fireplace, surround sound, TV and ample seating.</description>

      <description>Located in the heart of Meyerland, this brand new custom home was designed and built five feet off the ground after our clients endured not one, but two floods in their prior one-story ranch.
After purchasing and remodeling the home, the home was stuck in the 2015 Memorial Day flood. They reached out to On Point shortly after looking for guidance on whether a second remodel or a complete rebuild made the most sense.</description>

      <description>Trend alert – the smart home is getting even smarter! In this week’s blog post, we’re sharing some of the smartest and techy savvy products we discovered at the International Builder Show.
Whether you are building or remodeling, technology is becoming more accessible in price and easier to install and integrate throughout your house. The number one trend in smart technology is peace-of-mind. Products that allow homeowners to monitor their space and control it from afar seem to be the number one driver in innovation.</description>

      <description>In Part II of our IBS design trends blog series, we’re sharing the feedback and highlights surrounding your home’s finishes. From countertop and tile materials to sinks and faucets, here’s what to expect in 2018.
Starting in the Kitchen, the number one trend in cabinet layout and design is the use of open shelving. More homeowners are opting for a dedicated “messy” prep space (more insight in Part 1), and with the introduction of this luxury pantry, the added storage space eliminates the need for a lot of upper cabinetry in your main kitchen.</description>

      <title>What is a radiant barrier on residential roof decking?</title>
      <link>https://onpointcustomhomes.netlify.com/blog/what-is-a-radiant-barrier-on-residential-roof-decking/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2013 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://onpointcustomhomes.netlify.com/blog/what-is-a-radiant-barrier-on-residential-roof-decking/</guid>
      <description>We all know about the Houston, TX heat!! The primary reason to install a radiant barrier is reduce heat gain in the Summer and heat loss in the Winter. This is accomplished by reflecting the suns rays back toward the actual roof and not allowing them fully to penetrate the attic space.
There are many different applications for radiant barriers in residential attics. On new construction custom homes, the most common is for On Point Custom Homes is to install roof decking with the radiant barrier attached to the bottom of the decking.</description>

      <description>You may have seen a builder with initials after their name on a business card and often asked what that pertains to. It likely is an accreditation earned through the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). These accreditations demonstrate a builders commitment to continuing education, customer service and an overall understanding of today’s dynamic home building industry.
On Point Custom Homes commitment to these ideals is recognized in our staff’s ability to earn Certified Graduate Builder (CGB) degrees through the NAHB.</description>

      <title>Why is quartz gaining popularity in Houston homes?</title>

      <guid>https://onpointcustomhomes.netlify.com/blog/why-is-quartz-gaining-popularity-in-houston-homes/</guid>
      <description>On Point Custom Homes uses quartz in many of our modern Houston homes. Clients often ask why we use quartz…there are many reasons, but let’s cover some of the top reasons.
1) We believe quartz gives a more modern touch to a contemporary style home than granite. It has a clean overall feel and modern enthusiasts seem to be gravitating toward quartz countertops.
2) Ease of mainteance. Quite simply On Point Custom Homes recommends a damp cloth with warm water and soap to wipe down quartz.</description>

      <guid>https://onpointcustomhomes.netlify.com/blog/what-defines-a-houston-modern-home/</guid>
      <description>Houston itself is really a very old city, first founded in 1836 and then incorporated the very next year. It has modest beginnings until 1901 when it became a major oil producing area as well as a railway hub. The increasing workforce that these two types of industry brought into the then small town led to very rapid growth and the demand for both economic and luxury types of homes. Houston modern homes are not considered to be these original structures, although many of the plantation style mansions still gloriously line the streets of the older parts of the city.</description>

      <description>Houston modern patio homes offer the “lock and leave” lifestyle.
Lock and leave is a term often used by Realtors and marketers when describing the positive attributes or features of Houston modern patio homes. This term means that the owners can simply lock up and leave the home, which is important for those that travel for business or enjoy an easy maintenance lifestyle. The lower cost of owning a Houston modern patio home makes these home types a great option for people that only want to live in Texas for part of the year, who have kids leaving for college and want to downsize or want to live in a trendy location.</description>
