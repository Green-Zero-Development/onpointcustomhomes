We are often asked about this by past clients and potential clients. The answer is Yes! During the first five months of 2009, [On Point Custom Homes](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/) has completed 7 remodels and currently working on 4 additional jobs. Many of our current remodels are damaged homes on the Texas coasts from Hurricane Ike. We have jobs in Galveston, La Porte, Shore Acres, Bolivar Peninsula and Houstonâ€™s Inner Loop. At [On Point](http://www.onpointdevelopment.com/), we have taken pride in helping bring Texas families back to their homes post storm. We have worked diligently with insurance companies as well to ensure our clients receive fair settlements. If you are looking at a remodel, please give us a call to set us a free consultation.
