Summer in Houston usually brings homeowners outside to take in the pleasures of their yards. A familiar issue is mosquitoes and how to manage them, and a Houston mosquito system solution is becoming a necessity. [On Point Custom Homes](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/) is prepared to assist by offering a [Mosquito Lock](http://www.mosquitolock.com/) System. This innovative system allows homeowners complete control of their yard by spraying a very fine [mist](http://www.mosquitolock.com/our-systems.html) in intervals set on a controller, and is the most desired Houston mosquito system available. Operating automatically or with a handheld remote, the 30-60 second mist drifts and settles on the landscaping, killing all mosquitoes it comes in contact with along with numerous other pests. This system has given [On Point’s](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/) clients the freedom to enjoy being outside regardless of the season, and with additional features such as a warranty on all parts and installation, leak detection and an optional wind sensor, we are confident in providing this option to our clients. This system is also available to [On Point’s](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/) Houston remodeling clients.

There is still time to have this fantastic Houston mosquito system installed before the season peaks, so please contact [On Point Custom Homes](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/) to discuss having a [Mosquito Lock](http://www.mosquitolock.com/) System installed in your yard!
