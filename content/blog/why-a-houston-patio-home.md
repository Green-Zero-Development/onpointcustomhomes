Houston modern patio homes offer the “lock and leave” lifestyle.

Lock and leave is a term often used by Realtors and marketers when describing the positive attributes or features of Houston modern patio homes. This term means that the owners can simply lock up and leave the home, which is important for those that travel for business or enjoy an easy maintenance lifestyle. The lower cost of owning a Houston modern patio home makes these home types a great option for people that only want to live in Texas for part of the year, who have kids leaving for college and want to downsize or want to live in a trendy location.

_Another key feature with a lock and leave property is that there is minimal yard maintenance and upkeep. A quick weekly trip from the yard guy is about all you need to organize! No 8 hours of yard maintenance per week, leaf blowing for countless hours or sweeping the 100 ft. driveway!
