The Coronavirus pandemic has forced the world to make changes and adapt in virtually all aspects of life. With the school year quickly approaching, it is becoming more and more apparent that school may look very different for young students this year. With that in mind, it is very important that your children have a space that makes adapting to zoom schooling a little easier and helps separate their work and school space from the rest of your home. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sa32LyNkxzfeUk-LNpqg6eBpjaetPckc2asid-g548ROTC96iyJ9klyl-hWf_sAOtdtBoLl1cofBQGPFaJFlcafSiUgSmS50LmMRS15uZgu7364qv9u9XZ8clJdq9IyvVhDuDI-d =624x416)

Here at On Point, we design and create custom homes that suit each and every one of your needs and desires. This new normal of working from home and homeschooling has really highlighted just how important work spaces are in every home. Rather than having the kids homework pile up on the dining room table, this built in desk area allows your student to have a designated work space, making homeschooling a little less hectic. Here we have included some of our past projects where we have incorporated built in shelving and desk space.
