If you follow the adventures of On Point on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/OnPointCustomHomes/?fref=ts) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/onpointcustomhomes/), you’ve probably heard the news already, but if not, we’re excited to share that our team brought home some new hardware from the Texas Association of Builders! And by hardware, we mean [awards](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/about-us/recognition/), although we probably brought back some actual hardware samples, too.

Will and Evan spent the last half of last week in Dallas attending the Sunbelt Builders Show put on by the Texas Association of Builders. The highlight of the trip was the STAR Award Show, which recognizes excellence in all areas of the home building industry. With more than 500 entries, the STAR awards are the largest award show in the state and On Point was pleased to take home seven new awards! Take a look below to see what we won and browse photos from each project!
