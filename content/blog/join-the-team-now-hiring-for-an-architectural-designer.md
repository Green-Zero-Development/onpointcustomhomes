We are looking for someone to work with our architectural design team and expect this individual to be design-conscious and detail oriented. Because On Point deals with a niche set of clientele with big ideas, our architectural designers must have a desire to work on the more artistic side of construction. The individual must be able to accurately and efficiently convert a unique idea into a visually pleasing work of art for the client. The individual must be open to critique and changing demands made by the client, as well as the rest of the On Point team. Open collaboration with the entire On Point team is critical. The custom home building industry is constantly changing, and here at On Point we strive to stay ahead of the change and work with new ideas and designs. We expect the newest member of our team to be willing and ready for the ever-changing environment, as well as prepared to be a part of a continually growing and successful company.
