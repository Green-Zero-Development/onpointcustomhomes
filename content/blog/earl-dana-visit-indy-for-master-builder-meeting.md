[Earl](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/personnel/earl-correll/) and [Dana](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/personnel/dana-walker/) represented On Point for the Spring 2019 session of the Master Builders hosted by the enterprising owners and staff at Gradison Design-Build. Twice a year, a members invite-only group of construction industry leaders from the United States and Caribbean gather to share three days and nights of intensive sessions consisting of financial overviews, round-table discussions, best practices discussion forums, innovative construction techniques, the latest in applied technology and software, material sourcing and pricing, project reviews, site tours, vendor showcases and shared camaraderie. We look forward to these ongoing opportunities twice a year to not only help mentor, but be mentored and motivated by one another to strive for improved procedures and elevated goals. This particular session included the valuable addition of each company’s Selections Coordinator who engaged in their own simultaneous symposium of systems analysis, processes and procedures review, selections trends and vendor sourcing.

Local activities hosted by Team Gradison included a “Best Practices” discussion and Happy Hour hosted by the talented team at Ferguson Enterprises at the Indiana Design Center in Carmel, a presentation by Keynote Speaker Glenn Bill on “What it Takes to be a Good Builder From a Realtor Perspective”, and Project/Site Tours of Gradison Homes current projects and model homes in the communities of Maple Ridge, Chatham Hills and South Village of Nickel Plate. And of course, no visit to Indianapolis would be complete without a tour of the infamous Mass Ave District with a sips and bites tour of the local brews and delicious pub fare.
