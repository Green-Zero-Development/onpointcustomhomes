We all know about the Houston, TX heat!! The primary reason to install a radiant barrier is reduce heat gain in the Summer and heat loss in the Winter. This is accomplished by reflecting the suns rays back toward the actual roof and not allowing them fully to penetrate the attic space.

There are many different applications for radiant barriers in residential attics. On new construction custom homes, the most common is for [On Point Custom Homes](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/) is to install roof decking with the radiant barrier attached to the bottom of the decking.
