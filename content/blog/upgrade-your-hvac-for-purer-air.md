Now more than ever, we are all hyper-aware of all things health and wellness. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a heightened awareness of and desire to remain as healthy and clean as possible, both inside and out. While it can be difficult to control what you are coming into contact with when out in public, there is a solution for avoiding unwanted bacteria, germs, allergens, and pollutants in your home — install an air purification system.

Knowing where to start in terms of finding the best solution for air purification can be daunting. There are countless products and companies that claim to have the solution for all your AC wants and needs.

A simple way to start is to determine what you want out of an air purification system. Some may be looking to reduce dust build-up throughout the house or to filter out the pollen and dander that trigger seasonal allergies. Some might have more compromised immune systems and want to ensure that the air they are breathing in their own homes isn’t putting their health at risk.

Whatever your desires may be, there is an air purification system that is sure to help provide a safe, clean environment for you and your family.

One of the most cost-efficient options when thinking about air purification is installing a HVAC air purifying filter. The system essentially traps the bacteria and dust traveling through the air into the filter. While this option can be effective in reducing much of the dust build-up, it can only work while your AC is running, reducing the amount of time it spends eliminating the buildup of bacteria and allergens throughout your home.

Another technology proven to be effective in improving air quality is UV light. A UV light can be installed into your HVAC system and is known to protect from and eliminate many of the contaminants that enter the HVAC system. The APCO-X In-Duct Air Purification System utilizes UV light technology to disinfect the HVAC coils, avoiding the buildup of mold, dust, etc. which can then travel throughout your home.

A great option for more drastic air purification is the REME HALO In-duct Air Purifier. This product is intended to be used along with your existing HVAC unit. The technology allows for the air to be purified without having to pass through a filter in the unit, ensuring that every room receives the benefits of this product. This air purifier reduces allergens and kills bacteria and viruses as they enter your home, without the need to clean or replace filters.

While there are a wide variety of options, no matter which air purification system you select, you can rest easy knowing you are taking a huge step towards creating a healthier environment in your home. If you’re interested in learning more, contact your builder, remodeler or HVAC specialist to ask what options are available for your HVAC unit.
