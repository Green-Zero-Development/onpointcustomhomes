We are asked this question with more and more regularity. [On Point Custom Homes](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/) is proud to have a staff member, Earl Correll, who has earned his certified green professional (CGP) designation through the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). Through this designation, we are able to provide valuable insight to our custom home clients that wish to adopt green principles into their home. Also, we strive to add green building techniques into our inventory homes as we find environmentally friendly products that can enhance both our quality and finished product.
