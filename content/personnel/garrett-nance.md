Garrett was born and raised just south of Houston in Pearland, Texas. He was introduced to the construction industry in High School when he worked for a local commercial construction company during school breaks and summers. Garrett attended Texas A&M University where he earned his BBA in Finance. After graduation, he began working for a top residential builder in Houston as an estimator, where he learned the process behind budgeting homes as well as identifying cost savings opportunities. Garrett was able to expand upon his knowledge of the [residential home building industry](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/current-homes/) by taking classes through the Greater Houston Builders Association as well as visiting job sites and troubleshooting issues with project managers.

Garrett joined the On Point team in early 2017 as the Purchasing Manager where he is able to work closely with vendors and the design team to ensure an efficient and enjoyable building process for clients.

In his free time, Garrett enjoys spending time with family and friends. He can also be found out on the lake bass fishing, one of his biggest passions.
