While Rosie officially joined the On Point family in 2019, she has been a part of the team for many years. Working as a Real Estate Assistant alongside Leah Leggett, Rosie assisted on hundreds of our transactions over the years learning the ins and outs of the business. From leasing to staging and beyond, she has been a part of all phases of the real estate transaction. You’ll still find her today visiting job sites and staging our homes. With a knack for numbers and exceptional organization skills, Rosie found herself gravitating to the financial side of the business and began assisting On Point part-time with daily accounting tasks.

Rosie took a leap of faith to hang up her real estate hat and expand her accounting skills when she joined On Point full time in 2019. Since joining our accounting team, Rosie has enjoyed putting her keen attention to detail to work in the office.

Born in Houston, Rosie was raised with Salvadorian customs and traditions and is fluent in Spanish. When she’s not at work, she loves spending her time with her family and husband. In their free time, you can find them out on a dance floor or on a campsite. Fun fact, Rosie met John and Earl on a jobsite years ago as a teenager! Construction runs in the family – her dad and brother own a painting company, which is how she first met On Point many years ago!
