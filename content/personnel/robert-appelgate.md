Robert was born and raised just North of Houston making him a true born and raised Texan. Some of his earliest childhood memories include tagging along to work with his father, who worked in the home remodeling business. As he grew older, these experiences lead him to pursue a career in the construction industry with his first role being in the design and wiring of home theatre systems. During the ten years he spent in the industry managing various levels of residential projects, technology was evolving giving Robert a creative edge and insight into the smart home revolution. Robert was then given an opportunity to work with a leading electrical company where Robert became the key liaison with custom builders working in Houston’s most elite neighborhoods and homes. Working hand in hand with these custom home builders, Robert was introduced to all phases of the building process and with 20 years of experience joined On Point Custom Homes in early 2013 as a Senior Project Manager.

Robert’s passion for the [building industry and customer service](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/about-us/design-build/) has made him a favorite among On Point clients and staff. He oversees and manages new construction operations in the field from start to finish making the building process as seamless as possible for homeowners. His drive and dedication are a rare find but very true to his character.

While not working, Robert enjoys spending time with his wife and four sons. You can also find Robert enjoying his days off relaxing on some much needed “lake time” aboard his boat at Lake Houston.
