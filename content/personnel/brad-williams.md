Brad comes from a long line of craftsman, as both his father and grandfather were carpenters, so it’s no surprise that Brad has a natural ability when it comes to building. While he grew up all over the country traveling from city to city as an Army brat, but now proudly calls Houston home. Brad started his career with a production builder overseeing job sites and managing the construction process in some of Houston’s popular suburban communities.

After several years on the production side of building, Brad had the opportunity to run production and operations for a commercial HVAC company, while also founding and running his own residential remodeling company. Brad made his way back to the building world when he began overseeing projects for a custom builder in some of Houston’s top urban neighborhoods. Brad’s appreciation for the building process is apparent whenever you’re with him.

A wealth of information, Brad takes the time to understand your vision so he can bring it to life in a timely and efficient manner. He has a passion for woodworking and metal works and when he’s not hard at work, you can find him away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Houston enjoying hunting, fishing and gardening with his wonderful wife, 4 kids and 2 dogs.
