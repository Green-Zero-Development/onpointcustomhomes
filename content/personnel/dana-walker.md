Dana is no stranger to the homebuilding industry, in fact she often jokes that the homebuilding industry chose her. Coming from a family of humbly skilled craftsman, who together built their family’s lake house, barn, and various custom furniture pieces, is one of the reasons she made her way into the industry.

After joining a Houston-area custom builder shortly after graduating from the University of North Texas, she had the opportunity to work in various departments of the business from bidding and purchasing to permitting and accounting and eventually worked her way up to the selections team where she collaborated with architects and homeowners on interior finishes.

Dana believes in collaborating and uses her keen ability to listen to a client’s vision in order to assist homeowners when designing the interior vision for their home. Confidence and trust are key in the design process and Dana reinforces a client’s ideas in order to bring their ultimate vision to fruition. Her design philosophy is that every home is like a book, the exterior finishes are the cover and the interior finishes are the unique perspective or voice of the home. Ultimately, the goal is to create a space that provides a warm environment that will hold many memories for years to come.

A native Houstonian, Dana grew up in the Cypress area, but spent several weekends at her grandparent’s lake house in Livingston where most of her favorite memories took place. Whether it was fishing, camping, traveling or exploring, she has always enjoyed recharging in nature. She graduated from Cy-Fair High School in 2008 and eventually transferred to the University of North Texas where she got her BA in English. During her time there, she quickly got involved as an intern at the school newspaper and the Residence Hall Association at her dorm where she helped plan weekly housing programs to help build community. She was hired by the organization as the National Communication Coordinator and led a group of 32 Students to represent the university at the annual conference in 2012, where they won Best Delegation and Most Spirited. Her leadership and care for community development led to her interest in home building and design.

In her free time, she enjoys spending time with her family, game nights with friends, spoiling her dog, Haiku, movie nights at home and drinking coffee on the back porch.
