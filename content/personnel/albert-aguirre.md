Albert is a native Houstonian, and is the third generation in his family to work in residential construction. Unlike most teenagers, Albert’s free time included joining his father and uncle working as contractors on the weekends learning a wide variety of trades. Albert further developed his skillset after graduation over years managing and working on various residential projects before joining the On Point Custom Homes team in 2016.

Albert’s role includes managing our remodel projects as well as supporting our field operations in any way possible. His positive outlook and work ethic are a great fit within the [On Point family](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/about-us/)!

When not working, Albert can be found either with a fishing pole in hand or hanging out with his wife and two beautiful daughters around town.
