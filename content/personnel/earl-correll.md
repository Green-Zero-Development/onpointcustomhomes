Growing up with On Point’s founder John Leggett, Earl became interested in being a builder while spending summers working with his uncle who ran a construction business, and while watching his own family build their home.

While pursuing a general contractors license in North Carolina Earl accepted the opportunity to move out to Houston and join the On Point team in 2006. Since his arrival in Houston, he has received his Graduate Master Builder and Certified Green Professional designations from the National Association of Home Builders.

As President for On Point [Custom Homes](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/our-portfolio/), Earl manages all field construction operations of the company, including overseeing all company new construction, [remodeling](https://onpointcustomhomes.com/remodels/), planning and managing full-time employees. Having superb knowledge of building codes and requirements, he is able to ensure all homes are compliant with plans and specifications. With the experience gained by working for On Point, Earl eases the homebuilding process to make it a pleasant experience and uses his product expertise to guide clients through the custom building process from selections to scheduled walkthroughs to closing.

Earl loves spending time with his wife, three daughters and dog. He tries not to miss an opportunity to enjoy his hobby – duck hunting with his dog Lilly.
