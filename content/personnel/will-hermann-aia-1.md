+++
Kayla is a proud Texan, born and raised. She grew up on the coast in a small town “across the bridge” from Corpus Christi. From an early age, Kayla was fascinated with building and designing things, spending time helping her dad build anything they could get their hands on. She gained a passion for architecture after years of walking through open houses with her mom. She would critique the houses, pointing out what could have been done better, and always knew that her calling in life was for architectural design.  
  
After graduating from Texas A&M University (WHOOP!) with a Bachelor of Environmental Design and Master of Architecture degrees, Kayla had the opportunity to work in Austin on custom residential projects. She also resided in Little Rock, Arkansas for a period of time, and had the opportunity to round out her architectural skills by focusing on commercial buildings.  
  
After moving back to her home state, she decided that her true passion was helping people design their dream home. She loves getting to know her clients and their families and diving deep into how they live their everyday lives to get a sense of what matters to them. Her goal is to make the home design process a fun step in the entire building process. Kayla's knack for getting to know her clients, along with her passion for residential architecture, combine to create homes that are beautifully designed with a personal touch to suit the needs of each client.  
  
When Kayla is not designing dream homes, you can find her hanging out with her husband, family and friends. She loves doing anything outdoors. Her favorite place to be is fishing, hunting, riding four-wheelers or otherwise hanging out at her grandparent's farm. She also enjoys all sports (both playing and watching), and loves crafting.  
  
Gig ‘em and God Bless!
