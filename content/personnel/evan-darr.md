I was born and raised in Columbus, Texas; a small rural town about 60 miles West of Houston. Construction is in my blood as I grew up assisting my dad on many job sites helping him with building homes, remodeling, and doing all types of construction. When not tagging along on construction site visits, I played football, was on the powerlifting team and was active in Boy Scouts. After graduating high school, I attended Blinn College in Brenham and transferred to Sam Houston State University where I received a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance and a minor in Banking. I started my career with BAE Systems and learned many things relative to manufacturing; from inventory, purchasing, engineering, fabrication and all the way down to the guys putting the parts on the vehicles.

Before joining the On Point team, I worked for another Houston builder and before that spent most of my career in the manufacturing industry with a brief stint in Oil & Gas. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve learned how to manipulate data in excel to streamline processes and assist with improving overall operations.

I am extremely thankful for my wife and two kids that God has blessed us with. I enjoy fishing, hunting, four wheeling, and doing pretty much anything outdoors- especially playing in sand volleyball tournaments. I take pleasure in volunteering and being active in our church.
