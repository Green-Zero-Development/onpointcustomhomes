Maria Mast graduated with honors from the University Of Illinois where she earned a B.S. in Architectural Studies. Wanting to round out her architectural education she attended Texas A&M University where she graduated top five in her class and earned a Master of Architecture Degree and a degree certificate in sustainable urbanism.  
  
During her studies, Maria’s main design focus was sustainable residential design and the quadruple bottom line; a holistic design approach that addresses the economic, social, ecological, and sensual demands of any project. It has always been her desire to increase the quality of life for not only her clients, but for everyone who experiences her designs as well. Maria is often quoted saying “My passion and purpose in life is to create spaces that people are excited to come back to over and over again. My goal is to bring comfort to my clients’ everyday life; create a place they can truly call Home!”  
  
Inspired by a quote from one of her favorite architects, Frank Lloyd Wright, Maria believes that there is a unique home for every unique individual.  
  
“There should be as many (styles) of houses as there are kinds (styles) of people and as many differentiations as there are different individuals. A man who has individuality has a right to its expression and his own environment.” - Frank Lloyd Wright  
  
When Maria is not designing homes, she can be found playing with her 3 children, working out at the gym, or in her craft room.
