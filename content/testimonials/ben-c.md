Throughout much of the construction process, I was working and living in London – thousands of miles away from the <a href=\"https://onpointcustomhomes.com/current-homes/\"><strong>Construction Site In Houston</strong></a>. On Point took an innovative approach to ensure that I remained engaged through the construction project – this greatly improved my confidence in your company….<br><br>I feel that On Point demonstrated a genuine commitment to me and my project. The On Point team took the time to understand my objectives and aligned their activity to meet them. Communication was consistently excellent – even though my schedule meant that many discussions took place at odd hours. In the end, I was pleased that On Point delivered a quality product on-time and on-budget."
