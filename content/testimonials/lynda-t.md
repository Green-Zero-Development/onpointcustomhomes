testimonial_content = "John worked with me to make this [home building] dream a reality. We were able to customize the house to meet my every need, while holding up to a workable budget. John guided me through decisions I had to make with subcontractors and helped me make selections for everything from energy efficient appliances, to finishes, to the latest in security systems and audio/video.<br><br>When my wants exceeded my budget, they worked with me to find something that would be more in line. When I heard about something I wanted to try, they fully researched it and came to me with choices and solutions. When money got tight, they worked with me by putting off certain decisions until later when it was easier for me to fund them.<br><br>Since moving in on Thanksgiving Day, 2007, John and On Point Custom Homes have responded to my every need. They have honored every commitment and exceeded my every expectation. I have built and remodeled homes over the years, but this by far was the most positive experience."
